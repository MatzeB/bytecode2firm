bytecode2firm - a Java bytecode front end for libFirm.

Setup
------

For our simple runtime, you can just compile via make.

If you want as much Java library as possible,
you need libgcj on your system.  Install gcj. bytecode2firm needs
libgcj.so, and the precompiled runtime classes from gcj's rt.jar.
In Ubuntu, install "libgcj-10 gcj-4.4-jre-lib". (Hint: you might want
to make sure that gcj is not your default Java VM afterwards. See
"update-alternatives --config X", where X = {java, javac, javah, ...})
Locate the rt.jar and unzip it to an directory named "rt" in the source
directory (or specify -bootclasspath when invoking bytecode2firm).

For the initial setup, you can execute a script:

  ./setup_runtime_gcj.sh

Running
--------

$ ./bc2firm -cp <class path> <Main class name>

for example,

$ ./bc2firm -cp $HOME/Src/bytecode2firm-testsuite InvokeX

The resulting linked executable needs liboo_rt.so. It is compiled to look in the current directory.
